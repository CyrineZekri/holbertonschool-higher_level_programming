# Python - Test-driven Development 

This project focuses on understanding and implementing the test-driven development (TDD) approach in Python using the `doctest` module and Unit Tests. The `doctest` module allows us to write tests as docstrings within our code, making it easy to verify the correctness of our functions and methods.Unit tests provide a structured approach to testing individual units or components of our code. 

## Project Details

In this project, we will explore the following topics related to test-driven development using `doctest`:

1. Writing tests using docstrings: We will learn how to write test cases as docstrings within our code, making it easy to execute and validate the expected outputs.

2. Test case examples: We will provide examples of different test cases, including positive and negative scenarios, to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

3. Running tests using `doctest`: We will demonstrate how to run the tests using the `doctest` module and interpret the results.

4. Integration with existing code: We will explore how to integrate `doctest` into existing codebases and leverage the existing documentation as test cases.

5. Best practices: We will discuss best practices for writing effective tests, organizing test cases, and handling common scenarios in test-driven development.
