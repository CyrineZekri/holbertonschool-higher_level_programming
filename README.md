# holbertonschool-higher_level_programming

This repository contains projects and exercises related to higher-level programming concepts in Python.
It is part of my coursework at Holberton School Tunisia
## Sub-repositories

The "holbertonschool-higher_level_programming" project is organized into several sub-repositories, each focusing on a specific topic or concept. Here are the sub-repositories included in this project:

1. [python-hello_world](./python-hello_world): Introduction to Python programming with basic syntax and printing.
2. [python-if_else_loops_functions](./python-if_else_loops_functions): Conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python.
3. [python-data_structures](./python-data_structures): Working with data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
4. [python-more_data_structures](./python-more_data_structures): Advanced data structures like sets and  dictionaries as well as manipulation techniques.
5. [python-import_modules](./python-import_modules): Importing modules and using external libraries in Python.
6. [python-exceptions](./python-exceptions): Handling exceptions and errors in Python programs.
7. [python-classes] Concepts and examples related to object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on classes and instances.
7. [python-test_driven_development](./python-test_driven_development): Test-driven development (TDD) approach in Python, writing tests using the `doctest` module.
8. [python-more_classes](./python-more_classes): Exploring more object oriented concepts in Python, including properties and class types

Each sub-repository contains its own set of exercises and examples related to the respective topic. You can navigate to each sub-repository for more details and to access the specific code and documentation.
